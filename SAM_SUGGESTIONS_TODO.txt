1. Change control node to be robot-side:
    A. move "heartbeat" to be inside of gui, or its own node in gui repo
    B. merge auto/teleop motor command topics, remove robot state subscription from motor drivers
    C. change motor command publisher behavior inside of control node based on robot state (instead of switching pubs in motor drivers)
    D. need to handle heartbeat during auto (don't necessarily stop auto if we disconnect?)
    E. [add autonomy plumbing -- motor status subs, topics for comms with perception node]
